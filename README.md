# Minecraft Chat Log Viewer

## What is this?

Not my best work. Many years ago during COVID, I got bored and decided to make a website to make my Minecraft chat logs public.

### Live demo

Try it on [my website](https://mc.nqind.com/chat)

### Tech stack

In order to do this, I decided to choose the following tools:

- [Bootstrap]() as my frontend framework because I'm not good at CSS and it gets the job done incredibly well
- PHP for the backend because it's what I'm most comfortable with and was incredibly easy for this project
- This [PHP calendar tutorial](https://startutorial.com/view/how-to-build-a-web-calendar-in-php) I shamelessly copied off of. Works great, 10/10, ported to mobile with no issues
- [aha](https://github.com/theZiz/aha), the Ansi HTML Adapter, because it's the most Unix-like tool that converts ANSI terminal color codes to HTML. Necessary because a good portion of my logs are colorized. Dangit PaperMC, I want my colored logs back!
- A lot of barely-functional yet still responsive CSS that works to this day
